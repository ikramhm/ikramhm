Hi there, young scholars! ðŸ‘‹

I am Ikram, a Cloud and DevOps engineer with passion for the business of the Cloud. I am interested in Infra - Cloud, Web3 Infra, and whatever else comes on the market which has the potential to change how we compute and consume digital resources.

I work with AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Python, Bash, CI/CD (with Gitlab and GitHub Actions) and Docker.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an CloudWatch-Lambda-SNS intergration to send me regular updates as the Might Arsenal march towards the title.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes (CKAD alongside intergrations with EKS)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything which helps solve cumbersome admin tasks.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my PhD dissertation which is almost finished ... ðŸ‘€
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn?
